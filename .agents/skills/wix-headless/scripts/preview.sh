# Build the project and deploy a rotating preview URL.
#
# Usage:
#   bash <SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/preview.sh
#
# Run from the project directory (CWD = <project>/). Requires wix.config.json.
#
# Output: stdout is the preview URL that `npx @wix/cli preview` printed; the
# orchestrator captures it and records as outcome.previewUrl in run.json. All
# other CLI output goes to stderr.
#
# `preview` does NOT populate the Frontend link in headless settings — that's
# what `release.sh` is for. Use preview for fast iteration on a rotating URL;
# use release for production deploy + transactional-email URL stability.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — ok; preview URL on stdout
#   <other> — build or preview failed; stderr surfaces the underlying error
#             (TypeScript / Astro errors are code bugs, not endpoint drift —
#              the orchestrator's recovery ladder doesn't retry build).
