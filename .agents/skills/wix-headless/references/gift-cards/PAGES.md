# Phase 4 Pages — Gift Cards

Launched in **Step 7** alongside other verticals' `pages` scopes. Writes the `/gift-cards` route and patches `Navigation.astro` + `index.astro` at their declared markers. The Components scope's outputs (`src/utils/gift-cards.ts`, `src/components/GiftCardPurchase.tsx`, `src/styles/components-gift-cards.css`) must already exist before this scope runs.

## Scope

Files this agent OWNS (writes fresh):

- `src/pages/gift-cards.astro` — landing page; redirects to `/` when probe returns null

Files this agent PATCHES (insert at marker, preserve everything else):

- `src/components/Navigation.astro` — insert "Gift Cards" link at `<!-- nav:links -->`
- `src/pages/index.astro` — insert home teaser at `<!-- home:gift-cards -->`

Files this agent MUST NOT touch:
- `src/utils/gift-cards.ts`, `src/components/GiftCardPurchase.tsx`, `src/styles/components-gift-cards.css` — Components scope.
- Any other vertical's nav/home contributions.
- `Layout.astro`, `global.css`, or any product/cart/checkout page.

## Critical rules

1. **Marker-based patching.** Read the shell file, locate the exact marker comment string (`<!-- nav:links -->` or `<!-- home:gift-cards -->`), insert your snippet immediately AFTER the marker line, preserve the marker line itself. See `references/shared/IMPLEMENTER.md` § "Contributing to shared files via markers".
2. **Inject the import + frontmatter call when patching.** When inserting at `<!-- nav:links -->` in `Navigation.astro`, also add `import { getGiftCardProduct } from "../utils/gift-cards";` and `const giftCardsEnabled = (await getGiftCardProduct()) !== null;` to the file's frontmatter (top of the file). Same for `index.astro`'s home teaser. Do NOT assume another vertical added them.
3. **SSR error guards.** Wrap `getGiftCardProduct()` calls in try/catch with safe fallback (`giftCardsEnabled = false` / `giftCardProduct = null`). See `references/shared/IMPLEMENTER.md` § "SSR error guards". Although the helper itself never throws, the guard cost is zero and protects against future regressions.
4. **Redirect rather than render** when the page-level probe returns null. `if (!product) return Astro.redirect("/", 302);` — same pattern as private/disabled-feature routes elsewhere.
5. **Memoization is per-request.** Navigation, home, and the page may all call `getGiftCardProduct()` on the same request — the helper coalesces them into one fetch. You do not need to thread the result through Astro context.
6. **No HTML comments in `.astro` frontmatter** — frontmatter is TypeScript; use `//` or `/* */`.
7. **Image rendering uses `resolveWixImageUrl`** — the gift-card product's `image` field is a Wix media object identical in shape to product/blog images. Import from `../utils/wix-image`.

## Template files

Snippets to insert at markers live as standalone template fragments. Read each, substitute any contract-class adaptations, paste at the marker.

- `templates/gift-cards.astro` — full landing page
- `templates/_nav-snippet.astro` — single line for `Navigation.astro` (the `{giftCardsEnabled && <a>...</a>}` expression)
- `templates/_home-teaser-snippet.astro` — multi-line block for `index.astro` (the `{giftCardProduct && <section>...</section>}` block)

## Implementation

### 1. `src/pages/gift-cards.astro`

Use template `templates/gift-cards.astro`.

Frontmatter:
```astro
---
import Layout from "../layouts/Layout.astro";
import GiftCardPurchase from "../components/GiftCardPurchase.tsx";
import { getGiftCardProduct } from "../utils/gift-cards";
import { resolveWixImageUrl } from "../utils/wix-image";

const product = await getGiftCardProduct();
if (!product) return Astro.redirect("/", 302);

const heroImage = resolveWixImageUrl(product.image, 800, 800);
---
```

Body: hero image + name + description + `<GiftCardPurchase client:load product={product} />` + fineprint paragraph. All page-level CSS is already shipped via `components-gift-cards.css` (Components scope) — do not duplicate styles inside the `.astro` file's `<style>` block.

### 2. Patch `src/components/Navigation.astro`

1. Read the file.
2. Add to frontmatter (above the `---` close): `import { getGiftCardProduct } from "../utils/gift-cards"; const giftCardsEnabled = (await getGiftCardProduct()) !== null;` (split across two lines as needed).
3. Locate the line containing `<!-- nav:links -->`. Insert immediately after it:
   ```astro
   {giftCardsEnabled && <a href="/gift-cards">Gift Cards</a>}
   ```
4. If other verticals (stores, blog, forms) already inserted at the same marker, preserve every existing line — your snippet appends.

### 3. Patch `src/pages/index.astro`

1. Read the file.
2. Add to frontmatter:
   ```astro
   import { getGiftCardProduct } from "../utils/gift-cards";
   import { resolveWixImageUrl } from "../utils/wix-image";

   const giftCardProduct = await getGiftCardProduct();
   const giftCardImage = giftCardProduct
     ? resolveWixImageUrl(giftCardProduct.image, 800, 600)
     : null;
   ```
   (`resolveWixImageUrl` import may already be present from the stores patcher — if so, do not re-import.)
3. Locate the line containing `<!-- home:gift-cards -->`. Insert the teaser snippet immediately after it (see `templates/_home-teaser-snippet.astro`).

## Verification

After writing/patching, grep the project to confirm:
- `Navigation.astro` contains both the marker and the new link expression.
- `index.astro` contains both the marker and the new `<section class="gift-card-teaser">` block.
- `/gift-cards.astro` exists and references `GiftCardPurchase` (Components scope's island).

## Return format

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "phase": "gift-cards-pages",
  "scope": "pages",
  "summary": "Wrote /gift-cards page; patched Navigation + home with conditional gift-card surfaces",
  "data": {
    "pageWritten": true,
    "navigationPatched": true,
    "homePatched": true,
    "markersFound": ["<!-- nav:links -->", "<!-- home:gift-cards -->"]
  },
  "files": [
    "src/pages/gift-cards.astro",
    "src/components/Navigation.astro",
    "src/pages/index.astro"
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

If a marker is missing, return `status: "partial"` with `errors: [{ code: "MARKER_NOT_FOUND", file: "<path>", marker: "<marker>" }]`. Do NOT invent your own insertion point — that signals the designer foundation didn't scaffold the shell correctly and should be fixed upstream.

## Anti-patterns

| WRONG | CORRECT |
|-------|---------|
| Render the page when probe returns null | `Astro.redirect("/", 302)` |
| Skip the import-injection step (assume another vertical added `getGiftCardProduct`) | Always inject the import + the `await` call when patching, scoped to the file you're touching |
| Replace the marker comment with the inserted snippet | Insert AFTER the marker; preserve the marker line |
| Move CSS into `<style>` blocks inside `.astro` files | Page/teaser CSS lives in `components-gift-cards.css` (Components scope) |
| Hardcode `<title>"Gift Cards"</title>` | Use `title={\`${product.name}\`}` so the dashboard owner controls naming |
| Conditionally re-render the page when the app is enabled later | The Astro page is server-rendered each request — the probe runs every time, so dashboard changes are picked up without rebuild |
