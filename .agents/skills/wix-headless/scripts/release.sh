#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build the project and release to production. Unlike preview.sh, this populates
# the Frontend link in dashboard → Settings → Headless Settings → Manage URLs,
# which Wix injects into transactional emails (order confirmations, password
# resets, member invites). Use release.sh for production deploys.
#
# Usage:
#   bash <SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/release.sh
#
# Run from the project directory (CWD = <project>/). Requires wix.config.json.
#
# Output: stdout is the released URL that `npx @wix/cli release` printed
# (extracted from the line `Site published on <url>`); the orchestrator
# captures it as outcome.releaseUrl in run.json. All other CLI output goes
# to stderr.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — ok; release URL on stdout
#   <other> — build or release failed; stderr surfaces the underlying error.
#             Build failures are code bugs (TypeScript / Astro / missing
#             module) — the orchestrator does NOT retry. Release auth failures
#             surface as `Run npx @wix/cli login and retry.`
#             Known transient release failures are retried by this script.
