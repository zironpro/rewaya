**Article: Create and Publish Blog Posts with Rich Content and Images**

---

## Description

This article demonstrates how to create and immediately publish blog posts using Wix Blog REST API, including handling external images, rich content formatting, and proper media management workflow.

### Part 0: Get an Author/Member ID (Required for 3rd-Party Apps)

**IMPORTANT**: When calling the Blog API as a 3rd-party app (not as the site owner), `draftPost.memberId` is **required**. The API will reject requests with "Missing post owner information" if omitted.

1. Query site members to get a valid member ID using [List Members](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/members-contacts/members/member-management/members/list-members):

   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://www.wixapis.com/members/v1/members?fieldsets=PUBLIC&paging.limit=1" \
     -H "Authorization: <AUTH>"
   ```

2. Use the `id` field from the response as `draftPost.memberId` when creating the blog post. This member will be the post author.

   > **Note**: The member ID must belong to an existing site member or collaborator. If the members query returns no results, you may need to create a member first or use the site owner's member ID.

### Part 1: Import External Images to Wix Media Manager

1. Identify external image URLs from user input for cover images and embedded content images.

2. Import each external image using [Import File](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/assets/media/media-manager/files/import-file). This converts external URLs to Wix Media IDs required for blog posts.

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://www.wixapis.com/site-media/v1/files/import" \
     -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
       "mediaType": "IMAGE",
       "displayName": "Cover Image.jpg"
     }'
   ```

   The response will include a `file.id` field. Use this ID in blog post creation. Images with `operationStatus: "PENDING"` can be used immediately.

3. Store the returned file IDs for use in blog post creation.

### Part 2: Create Blog Post with Rich Content

1. Create blog post using [Create Draft Post](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/blog/draft-posts/create-draft-post) for single posts, or [Bulk Create Draft Posts](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/blog/draft-posts/bulk-create-draft-posts) for multiple posts.

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://www.wixapis.com/blog/v3/draft-posts" \
     -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "draftPost": {
         "title": "My Blog Post",
         "memberId": "author-member-id",
         "richContent": {
           "nodes": [
             {
               "type": "PARAGRAPH",
               "nodes": [{
                 "type": "TEXT",
                 "textData": {
                   "text": "This is a paragraph with some content.",
                   "decorations": []
                 }
               }],
               "paragraphData": {}
             }
           ]
         },
         "media": {
           "wixMedia": {
             "image": { "id": "mediaId" }
           },
           "displayed": true,
           "custom": true
         }
       },
       "publish": true
     }'
   ```

2. Structure rich content using Ricos JSON format. Reference [Ricos documentation](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/assets/rich-content/ricos-documents/introduction) for complete node structure. Common node types:
   - `PARAGRAPH` for text content
   - `HEADING` for section headers
   - `IMAGE` for embedded images (requires Wix Media ID)
   - `ORDERED_LIST` and `BULLETED_LIST` for lists
   - `BLOCKQUOTE` for quoted text
   - `LIST_ITEM` for individual list items

   **CRITICAL**: All TEXT nodes MUST be wrapped in PARAGRAPH nodes within their parent containers.

   **Correct Ricos structure example:**

   ```json
   {
     "nodes": [
       {
         "type": "PARAGRAPH",
         "nodes": [
           {
             "type": "TEXT",
             "textData": {
               "text": "This is a paragraph with some content.",
               "decorations": []
             }
           }
         ],
         "paragraphData": {}
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   **Correct BLOCKQUOTE structure:**

   ```json
   {
     "type": "BLOCKQUOTE",
     "nodes": [
       {
         "type": "PARAGRAPH",
         "nodes": [
           {
             "type": "TEXT",
             "textData": { "text": "Quote text here", "decorations": [] }
           }
         ],
         "paragraphData": {}
       }
     ],
     "blockquoteData": { "indentation": 1 }
   }
   ```

   **Correct LIST_ITEM structure:**

   ```json
   {
     "type": "LIST_ITEM",
     "nodes": [
       {
         "type": "PARAGRAPH",
         "nodes": [
           {
             "type": "TEXT",
             "textData": { "text": "List item text", "decorations": [] }
           }
         ],
         "paragraphData": {}
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. For embedded images in rich content, use IMAGE nodes with Wix Media IDs:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "IMAGE",
     "nodes": [],
     "imageData": {
       "containerData": {
         "width": { "size": "CONTENT" },
         "alignment": "CENTER"
       },
       "image": {
         "src": { "id": "mediaId" },
         "width": 900,
         "height": 600
       },
       "altText": "Descriptive alt text"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Set `publish: true` to immediately publish the post rather than saving as draft.

### Part 3: Handle Categories and Tags (Optional)

1. Resolve category IDs using [List Categories](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/blog/category/list-categories) if user provides category names.

2. Resolve tag IDs using [Query Tags](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/blog/tags/query-tags) if user provides tag labels.

3. Include resolved IDs in `categoryIds` and `tagIds` arrays in the draft post object.

### IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Never mock blog posts or media IDs - always use the APIs to import images and create posts
- Always read the full documentation of methods before implementation
- External images MUST be imported via Import File API before use in blog posts - direct external URLs will not work
- For 3rd-party app integrations, `memberId` is mandatory - use the [List Members](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/members-contacts/members/member-management/members/list-members) API if needed to get member ID
- Use ONLY the file ID (without `wix:image://v1/` prefix) for both cover images and embedded images
- Rich content IMAGE nodes require both `width` and `height` properties in the `image` object
- Images with `"operationStatus": "PENDING"` from import can be used immediately in blog posts
- Set `publish: true` in the request to publish immediately rather than save as draft
- For multiple posts, use Bulk Create Draft Posts API with `draftPosts` array
- Include `fieldsets: ['URL']` to get post URLs in the response
- Handle image import failures gracefully - continue without images if import fails
- Provide meaningful `displayName` values during image import for better organization
- Use appropriate Ricos node types (PARAGRAPH, HEADING, LIST, etc.) for semantic content structure
- Consider batching image imports when creating multiple posts with many images

### CRITICAL RICOS JSON STRUCTURE RULES:

- **NEVER place TEXT nodes directly in BLOCKQUOTE, LIST_ITEM, or other container nodes**
- **ALL TEXT nodes MUST be wrapped in PARAGRAPH nodes within their parent containers**
- **BLOCKQUOTE nodes must contain PARAGRAPH nodes, which contain TEXT nodes**
- **LIST_ITEM nodes must contain PARAGRAPH nodes, which contain TEXT nodes**
- **Failure to follow proper nesting will result in parsing errors: "Expected a paragraph node but found TEXT"**
- **Always validate Ricos structure before sending to ensure TEXT nodes are properly nested**

### Troubleshooting

| Error                                      | Cause                       | Solution                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Missing post owner information"           | `memberId` not provided     | Add `draftPost.memberId` - see Part 0 for how to get one            |
| "memberIds ... do not exist"               | Invalid member ID           | Query members first using List Members API to get valid IDs         |
| "Expected a paragraph node but found TEXT" | Invalid Ricos structure     | Wrap TEXT nodes in PARAGRAPH nodes (see structure rules above)      |
| Image not displaying                       | Using external URL directly | Import image via Media Manager first, then use the returned file ID |
