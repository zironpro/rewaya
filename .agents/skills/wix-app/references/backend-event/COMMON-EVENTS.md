## Payload Shape

The event envelope structure varies by API — the path to the main entity differs (e.g., `event.entity`, `event.data.order`). Use TypeScript and your IDE for autocomplete and type safety. See each event's API reference link above for the exact payload shape.

All envelopes include a **metadata** object with context such as event ID, entity ID, timestamp, and instance ID.
