Incentivize customers to spend above the store's current average order value (AOV) by creating threshold-based discounts that reward higher cart totals.

---

## Business Goal

**Goal ID:** `UPSELL_BOOST`

The merchant wants to increase the average amount customers spend per order. This is achieved by setting a minimum subtotal condition above the current AOV, so customers are encouraged to add more items or upgrade to higher-priced products to unlock the discount.

---

## KPIs

| KPI | Definition | How to measure |
|---|---|---|
| Average Order Value (AOV) | Total revenue / total orders | `getSiteData` — revenue / ordersCount |
| Revenue per order | Gross revenue attributed to each completed order | Track via order data before and after campaign |
| Discount redemption rate | Orders qualifying for the discount / total orders | Count orders with the discount applied vs total |
| Cart size increase | Change in items per order after campaign | Compare items per order pre/post |

---

## Triggers

Activate this goal when the merchant expresses any of the following intents:

- "increase AOV"
- "boost order value"
- "upsell"
- "get people to spend more"
- "increase average order"
- "raise order size"
- "higher cart value"
- Any request mentioning order value, spending thresholds, or minimum purchase incentives

---

## Recommended Actions

### Primary: Flow: Upsell Boost Campaign

The primary action for this goal. Creates a percentage discount with a `minSubTotal` condition set above the current AOV. The discount percentage and threshold are tiered based on the store's average profit margin.

**When to use:** Always the first recommendation for AOV-focused goals. Works best when the store has clear AOV data and margin information.

**Key mechanics:**
- minSubTotal set to 1.15x-1.5x the effective AOV (based on margin tier)
- Discount percentage scaled to margin (10-20%)
- Scope prioritized: CATEGORY (high-margin) > ITEMS (specific upsell candidates) > SITE (fallback)

### Secondary: Flow: Bundle & Save Campaign

A complementary action that increases AOV by encouraging multi-item purchases. Instead of a subtotal threshold, it uses an item quantity threshold.

**When to use:** When the catalog has natural cross-sell opportunities (complementary products, accessories, related items). Particularly effective when the store has many lower-priced items where quantity-based incentives drive higher totals.

**Key mechanics:**
- minItemQuantity condition (typically 2-3 items)
- Targets categories with cross-sell potential
- Can run alongside an upsell boost if scoped to different categories

## Measurement Plan

### Before campaign launch

1. Record baseline AOV from `getSiteData` (revenue / ordersCount)
2. Record baseline items per order
3. Note the campaign start date

### During campaign (weekly check-ins)

1. Compare current AOV to baseline
2. Track discount redemption rate
3. Monitor margin impact (ensure effective margin stays above 15%)

### After campaign (30-day assessment)

1. Calculate AOV lift: `(new_aov - baseline_aov) / baseline_aov * 100`
2. Calculate incremental revenue attributable to higher order values
3. Assess whether the minSubTotal threshold needs adjustment:
   - If redemption rate > 80% — threshold may be too low, consider raising
   - If redemption rate < 10% — threshold may be too high, consider lowering
   - Sweet spot: 20-40% redemption rate

## Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Flow | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Clear AOV data, margin data available | Upsell Boost (primary) | Full data enables optimal threshold + discount calculation |
| Low-data store (few orders) | Upsell Boost with conservative defaults | Use price_p50 as AOV proxy, 10% discount, 1.15x threshold |
| Catalog has natural bundles | Bundle & Save (secondary) | Multi-item incentive drives AOV through quantity |
| Both AOV and cross-sell opportunity | Both flows, different scopes | Upsell Boost on high-value categories, Bundle & Save on accessories |
| Merchant specifies exact values | Honor merchant input | User overrides always take priority over calculated values |
